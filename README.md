# Issues
Some game files containing blocks have missing values thus created blueprint has blank blockid values and calculator skips them while counting blocks in a blueprint. There are 2 possbile ways to fix it, either keen fills missing spots or I create a mod that overwrites files with complete version. The list of blocks is not long and for now the issue has been [reported here](https://support.keenswh.com/spaceengineers/pc/topic/null-subtypeid-values_1).
